        <p><span class="lead">In the beginning,</span> your ideas are fragile. The journey from concept to reality is a lengthy one, and the waters inevitably uncertain. It's easy for things to come out wrong, or not come out at all.</p>

        <p>So, bridges must be built between dreaming and doing. The heart of a creative idea must be carefully excavated, then funneled into a clear and actionable plan. Technical hurdles must be sized up, sorted through, and handled. Then, through these strange, funny, mundane-seeming little tasks, you watch the stuff in your head flower into stuff in the world.</p>

        <p>These are the jobs I live for.</p>
