<p class="big"><span class="lead">Here is an allegory.</span> Imagine you've painted a landscape, with teal mountains and golden fields and deep green forests and a cornflower blue sky. It is your first landscape, and it was—frankly—<i>utterly terrifying</i> to dive into it. However, after toiling lovingly over it for the past few weeks, you are fully, gleefully immersed. This painting thing, holy fuck, you love it. And, it is finally starting to come together. Things are <i>working</i>.</p>

In your newly flowered creative heart, though, you feel a certainty: there is still a bit more to do. The landscape needs a *nice glowing yellow sun in the right-most area of the sky*. It tugs at you, kindly but pressingly, until you acquiesce. *Yes.* The new image in your head warms your belly. This last element will balance everything out and make things feel truly complete.

The problem is, you don't own any yellow paint. Moreover, you've never painted with yellow paint. Do yellow paints behave the way other paints do? You are really not sure. The internet has many passionate yet conflicting opinions about it. And you really don't want to ruin your almost-completed-darling-first perfect-beautiful-landscape painting by attempting something you've never done before.

So you hire a yellow paint expert.

When they arrive, they come in with a lot of equipment. Three suitcases, a backpack, two unusual looking empty palettes, a steel case with many brushes, and some sort of headgear. They heftily but adroitly set it all down next to your landscape, which is promptly dwarfed. Despite some inner intimidation, you explain your vision to them.

*"I want a nice round circle of yellow in the upper right of my blue sky."*

The yellow specialist nods seriously, then opens a briefcase with what appears to be several hundred shades of yellow. They select several of them and immediately begin painting over your teal mountains.

Maybe you didn't explain yourself clearly enough. This is, after all, your first time.

*You: "Hey, sorry. Maybe I explained this badly. I just want a sun."*

*Yellow: "Right. So, the thing is there are some other issues that need addressing first. I'm noticing a concerning lack of yellow highlights in your mountains. This is a crucial element that non-yellow-specialists often miss. It is a yellow best practice that I would emphatically recommend."*

*You: "Okay, but the pervasive teal is intentional on my part; I like how it implies there is no sunlight hitting the mountains. I like the sadness."*

*Yellow: "Ah, I see. Of course. In that case I can use these three yellow shades instead, which have a more melancholy quality."*

You have no response for this. You watch the thing you found special and unique about your mountains fade into homogenization as they proceed. Your landscape is beginning to put out more of a La Quinta Inn family suite vibe. The melancholy yellows do not seem to abate this.

The specialist finally seems to be starting in on a sun-like object, but on the *left* instead of the right like you asked.

*You: "Hey sorry but I want the sun on the right."*

*Yellow: "Hmm, I see. Why on the right?"*

*You: "I don't know... it's just a feeling."*

*Yellow: "Well, I would strongly recommend it go on the left instead&mdash;it's really important to pay attention to the overall yellow cohesion. Putting the sun on the left is the only way there will be proper cohesion between the sky and the special yellows in the mountains. Please trust me on this."*

*You: "Okay..."*

You stare at the upper right sky where your inner muse is irately certain should be the exact fucking location of your sun. But, what does your muse know? This is your first landscape. This guy is a *yellow specialist*. And suns are *yellow*.

You defer, and hope for the best. In your heart, you can feel your muse organizing a wake and a funeral.

<div class="divider"></div>

Did the yellow expert actually know better about what would improve the painting? It seems clear they did not. Yet, as the novice in the room, you were powerless to assert your authority. Why?  

#### Knowledge as a Pyramid

We assume technical knowledge exists in a stacked, hierarchical manner. We view it as a pyramid. You begin at the bottomThe smaller and more specialized the knowledge, the further up on the a pyramid we assume it must be. If someone shows us their square and it is densely-packed and tiny, we are duly impressed&mdash;that square must be *really* high up on the pyramid in order to be that tiny! Really, *really* tiny square? Holy crap, you must be some kind of crazy genius. You are speaking English but I don't know 80% of the words you are using. You *must* be smart.

[ pyramid layers: paints --> paints only landscapes --> paints only yellow landscapes  ]

This is not a terrible model. It holds a lot of truth about how we learn. We begin with ground-floor concepts that can be assembled with other concepts we already know. Once internalized, we can then use them to understand more "advanced" concepts. All "advanced" means is: I can only assemble this concept using other concepts that are equally esoteric. As we proceed, this knowledge becomes more dense. We live in a progressively tighter space, but each one contains just as many new facts. We can rinse and repeat this process all the way up the specialization pyramid until things feel too claustrophobic, too unrelated to lived experience, or we run out of money for grad school.

That said, the pyramid view creates distortions, which lead to very real effects. First,

Simply put, the more technical person is *just smarter*. And, when it comes to conflicting opinions, this  carries with it a substantial amount of weight.  

As technicians, we are often clouded by tunnel vision within own own domain. The yellow specialist only sees:

1. *Yellow things*, which are all really sophisticated and important.
2. *Non-yellow things*, which are trivialities for the uneducated amateur.

This view always creates a danger: we use our substantial knowledge in one area as justification to impose their general creative vision over your own?

This scenario doesn't always play this way. But, it very, very often does. This is what it often feels like to bring an outside technician into a creative project. Someone has a project, a desire, an ambition, which is quite dear to them, and quite important. They've done all they can themselves, but have reached the bounds of their knowledge, and require your help. This is when a patient goes to a new doctor with an undiagnosed condition. A person brings their car to a mechanic. A business owner hires a development team to build them an app.

In each of these, the vulnerability lies with the person reaching out: they don't know what they don't know, so they have no ability to assess your recommendations. By default, we defer to the person with technical skills surpassing your own because they "know more." Yet, there is a dissonant push-pull rattling around in their minds: *I am the one who understands and cares for my project, and this person has had only a cursory glance at it. Yet I feel I must defer to their opinion on what is best.*

And here's the thing: this is understandable. Technical things are hard. This is why we bristle at the freewheeling right-brained flights of fancy of the non-technician. They all appear to be trotting around in an enviable bliss state of willful ignorance. *"Oh, I could never learn to code."* Yes, you *could*. You just *choose not to*, so you go to more parties and play more golf. You continue play ostrich to the thousands of little problems that I must solve each day in order to "make magic happen" for you.

It is also why we think we know what is best for them. After all, we are the experts. You can put this another way: after all, we are the *creators*. After all, we are the *gods*. And, we really are&mdash;it took years and years of study and practice to be able to do what they do. And we truly do hold our world's aloft. This is *our domain*, *our terf*, *our world*, under-appreciated and complained about by its inhabitants, despite their utter inability to understand or care for it.

Like Atlas, you can't help but find some contempt for the frolicking denizens of the lush, bountiful planet you labor to keep aloft. You can't help but view them as opinionated children, unfamiliar with the adult world, and ignorant of what is best for them. *"Hey kids, please show some respect for the stressed-looking person holding up your entire world."*[ Eloi vs. Morlocks? ]

However, there is a tendency to assume that just because we know more, we also know better. We can let this I-can-do-things-you-can't narrative distort how we evaluate others, and we create an internal, uncrossable chasm between us and them. Technical skills are pernicious in that they create a hard stop between the able and the unable. This is what we love about them, really. An exceptional project manager may be able to communicate, inspire, and organize far better than any coder can. Yet they possess no individual skill that the developer simply *can't do*. The coder can critically appraise every email and decision the manager makes, while meanwhile remaining safe from reciprocal judgement. After all, they can code, which makes them by definition "smarter."    

#### Rockstar Coders vs. Actual Rockstars

Once this hierarchical mentality begins to seep in, it is quickly extrapolated to the relationships between technicians for who is the smartest person in the room. It becomes a competition for the consummate safety found at the summit of IQ Mountain.

Every developer wants to be a "rockstar coder." What does this mean? This means your technical abilities are head and shoulders above the rest of your peers. It means you stand out. It means you get "10x results." This makes you special. It makes you&mdash;to a large extent&mdash; *untouchable*. It means the rules don't apply to you. It means you solve problems an order of magnitude faster and more elegantly than those around you. And therefore, it seems to follow that you will know better what is best for a project, and for others.

But is this true? Does having the most technical skills automatically mean you will make the best choices? To answer that, let's look at music. Here is a song by some of the most proficient session musicians in the world, with their creativity left unconstrained by serving the projects of other, less skilled peers. Based on the above hierarchical mentality, it should be one of the best songs of all time.

As you may have noticed, the creative zenith of the world's finest instrumentalists&mdash;finally unfettered from the constraints of lesser musical abilities and free to soar into the stratosphere&mdash;sounds remarkably like an early Seinfeld theme song reject.

#### Woodwind Power Struggle

Here is a real-life example from when I was involved in music production. During the throes of recording an album, it is very common to bring in outside specialized musicians. Think string sections, brass players, harpists, e.g. instruments that rock bands don’t have. These kinds of musicians are generally highly educated, highly skilled classical or jazz players. They would come into the studio at the beginning of the work day, pull their instruments from polished, expensive cases and warm up impressively, blazing through cascades of scales and chords to which even my trained ears could barely keep pace.

*Well, this day should happen easy enough,* I would think to myself. *So nice to have a trained professional for a change.*

After shepherding them to their place and setting up the mics, I’d explain to them the simple thing I wanted.

*"I think the best thing would be to play these three notes in this kind of manner at these certain moments in the track."*

A dozen more takes and a producer’s exhausted vocabulary later, we were still trying to get it. I simply could not get them to play what I wanted without them making it overly ornate. Often they wouldn’t even listen at all. It was like pulling teeth. It almost always took ten times the communication effort to get them to adapt and do the thing that would make the track "work."

After an astoundingly similar series of these experiences, it finally dawned on me: *highly proficient people often confuse having the most technical skills with having the best taste.* Yet these two things are vastly different; sometimes they are even opposites.

The same thinking is going on here, and causing the problem: if I bring in a classical saxophonist, they will conclude they have more authority to decide what to do with a saxophone on my track than I do. This seems logical, and it is actually difficult to locate a strong argument against it. In order to do that, we must first talk about investment and value.

#### Bad Maps

By nature, the more we invest ourselves in something, the more value we ascribe to it. We can see this with the people we love, but it also with the skills to which we devote ourselves. We will always place more value on the things we are good at doing. [examples] This matters because it means we all distort our value map of the world based on what we’ve invested in. This, incidentally, is why it can be highly effective to have a less specialized generalist oversee large projects. More salient, though, is that it means we as technicians do not necessarily have the most accurate view of reality. Sometimes our expertise will cause us to know best, but our expertise does not guarantee that we will know best.

#### Fill in the Gaps... but ONLY the Gaps

The sweetest spot is to be like those music professionals: to conscientiously erect technical guardrails where they are needed, but otherwise pave the path as broadly as possible for your client to go in the direction they want. We must assume there is major value in their non-technical vision, expressly because it is non-technical. That is: it will have a higher chance of having a non-distorted value map, because it lacks the acute spikes of investment that come with technicians' points of view.

#### A Circle Is A Failed Square

Correct interpretation of ideas is crucial; without it, all the technical abilities in the world are meaningless. In my experience, more often than not great ideas fail primarily because they are not interpreted correctly.

Outside-the-box ideas are especially vulnerable to misinterpretation. Most technicians work off of familiar templates, of things they already know. This is just how their brains work — in order to work at all, technical endeavors require immense amounts of order. Therefore technicians love order. Diagrams. Outlines. Categories. Subcategories. This item goes in this box, and this one goes in this box. There we go — everything is neat and tidy and actually works. And, most ideas fall within existing templates.

When there is no template, however, things tend to break down. Whomever you hire will tend to try to force your vision into the closest existing box, inadvertently removing its vitals and undermining its power. Then, when it fails, we conclude, “I guess my idea must be worthless” or “my technician wasn’t good enough.” While this is sometimes accurate, often (I would argue very often) it is that an idea was stripped of its “magical essence” in the interpretation. We deform a perfect circle by shoving it into a familiar box, and then everyone calls it a failed square.
