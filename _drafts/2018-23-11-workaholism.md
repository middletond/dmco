<p class="big"><span class="lead">No matter how vilified,</span> or how celebrated, each of my outward behaviors are internally driven by two pistons. In the one cylinder, there is fear. In the other, inspiration. Sometimes these pistons work together, clasping hands like twin sisters in a three-legged race, surging forward in tandem. Other times all the strain falls to one, while the other eases into motionlessness. But there is never one without the other. And they are both yoked to the same wheels. Both impel the same external action.</p>

Consider workaholism, that enduring American favorite. Despite a culture soggy with sunrise-and-yoga-smeared wellness, why do many of us continuously prioritize productivity over physical and mental health?

In the one cylinder, fear.

Fear of inevitable lack, of being an imposter, of failing to please that dark, towering, infinitely stern and disapproving taskmaster inside us, perpetually emitting judgements: *not fast enough, not clever enough, not meticulous enough, not insightful enough, if you don't get your act together they are all going to see how inept and underwhelming you actually are.* Signals of this activity flicker on the surface of personalities: furrowed brow, I'm-sorry-this-isn't-perfect apology underscoring all talk, disgust over anything remotely self-congratulatory. How much of today's dispensable orchestra of overwrought technologies, products, and experiences exist because of this one feeling?

Surely, this is not good for us. Surely, this is unilaterally bad. Surely, we need to send all the poor workaholics to a self-love rehab center. Yet to paint the behavior exclusively in this manner is crucially incomplete.

In the other cylinder, inspiration.

Here is a simple experiment to try. Wake up on your day off after going to bed early the night before, and drink the first half of a single cup of your favorite coffee. Then, lie down for ten to fifteen minutes, and observe the energized feelings and excited, detailed plans that arise. Though synthetic, this is not a false feeling. We ritualize caffeine not because it bestows a uniquely fabricated high, but because we recognize its natural, cherished forerunner.

The deeply nourishing rush of productivity is perennial and real. It is life-giving to be useful. It is electrifying and empowering to convert chaos into order by your own sweat. Think of the child jumping up and down and exclaiming, *"I did it!"* for the first time. You can hear the delighted shock in their voice. At some point in our past, each of us experienced that initial feeling of *achievement*. Can you really tell me that this comes from a place of *fear*? From a place of *soul-destroying lack*? For many of us, we had just stumbled on the most vivid, panoramic joy available.

Our lives would never be the same.

[ difference between productivity and achievement? ]

[ different between creativity and productivity? maybe they are the same? e.g. both are organizing chaos using a learned discipline. ]
