At some point in time, I discovered that technical learning was a magical avenue to safety from the judgement of others.

The inter-personal dynamic created by technical skills is different than others. With non-technical skills, the dynamic is *qualitative*. For example, all of us can write words. Authority in this area is based on *how well* one can write. This leaves everyone in a group exposed&mdash;to some extent at least&mdash;to constant evaluation from everyone else.

This can be kind of a stressful place to be. It is *not a safe place*. Regardless of how justified it may be, literally everyone can judge you. Everyone can have opinions about where you need to improve, and where you fell short.

Perhaps this sounds like normal, healthy competition. Like the natural, inevitable dynamic of being active and engaged in the world. And perhaps it is. Hierarchies happen. Silent rankings are quietly agreed upon in private workplace conversations. This is good for us. It pushes us to greater things. To be our best selves.

But, what if we hate doing it this way? What if we find the competition distasteful, dissonant, stressful? Perhaps we are a bit more sensitive than most. The low, static buzz of perpetual position jockeying feels needless and hurtful. What if we hate living in this exposed hierarchy? Is there a way out? A different approach?

Well, here's one: learn an esoteric skill that the general population doesn't understand. This shifts the dynamic from qualitative to quantitative. It is binary. *I am able do this thing, and you are not. Hard stop.* Suddenly, you are no longer exposed to the world's judgements. Suddenly, you have a leg up on them.

Consider the lone web developer in a small media company. Is this person *good* at their job? Even amidst the worst technical disaster, no one can authoritatively criticize them, because no one else can do what they do. The assumption is, *they can do things I can't do, and also can do all the things I can do.* A hard stop between skills sucks the power out of anything qualitative. A non-technical person may be a hundred times better at communication and organization. Yet once we flip things to binary valuations, this ceases to matter. The person who can code *is able* to communicate and organize, even if they do it significantly less well. They remain a person who knows everything you know, plus some "smart person" stuff that is further up the knowledge pyramid that normal folks don't understand.
