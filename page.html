        <h2 class="center">Building an <b>online presence</b> for the world's most <b>beloved magazine</b> about <b>recording music.</b></h2>

         <p class="big"><span class="lead">In my early 20s,</span> aside from all the usual early 20s things, I was fumbling and groping my way through a nascent career in music production. Sometimes during this period I would manage to swallow my pride and solicit career advise from smarter, cooler, more established musicians. The more I did this, the more I noticed a common imperative in their replies:</p>
         <p class="big"><i>"Do you read Tape Op?"</i></p>
         <p class="big"><i>"You really should be reading Tape Op."</i></p>
         <p class="big"><i>"When I started out, I read every issue of <i>Tape Op</i> I could get my hands on."</i></p>
         <p class="big"><i>"You just have to work your ass off. But also, be sure to subscribe to Tape Op."</i></p>

         <p>It turned out <i>Tape Op</i> was a bi-monthly magazine utterly devoted to recording music. It was founded by John Baccigaluppi and Larry Crane, two working-class, west-coast recording engineers with well-known bodies of work, and despite feeling incredibly home-grown (which it was), it had the largest circulation of any magazine of its kind in the world. Regular reading, though, wiped the surprise from this fact.</p>

         <p>Each issue was an ardent love letter to the craft disguised as a dense trade publication. Celebrity readers like Pete Townsend and Trent Reznor elbowed out space in the letters section alongside unknown kids recording songs in their bedroom to weigh in on and debate particulars of the profession. Its centerpiece was sprawling, spontaneous, conversational interviews with music industry professionals ranging from glaringly famous to quietly obscure. These interviews &mdash; full of humanizing tangents and random bursts of effusive technical talk &mdash; functioned sort of like an anti-<i>Rolling Stone</i>; instead of taking individuals and transmuting them into larger-than-life cultural icons, <i>Tape Op</i> took unimpeachable superstars of the musical world and talked to them in a way that made you realize, "Oh, that famous person’s just a normal, geeky dude. They're gushing about that same $100 piece of equipment I just bought. They're talking about all the times they completely fucked up a project."</p>

         <p>A clear message arose from repeated readings: <i>we were all the same.</i> We were all wide-eyed, nerdy kids astonished and in love with the magic of sound, and the profound emotions it could stir in us. Once every two months, <i>Tape Op</i> provided us a communal place to gather and gush.</p>

         <div class="divider"></div>

         <p>By the time I moved from my hometown of Boston to settle in Sacramento, I had been visiting this communal place for years. When I offered to build a website (it would be my first and I had no idea if I could do it, but I omitted this fact) for the sweet, jovial owner of the recording studio I had begun working out of, I had no I idea I was talking to <i>Tape Op</i> magazine's publisher, John Baccigaluppi. Later, when I did find out, the fanboy in me was still processing the implications of this while John asked if I could do the same thing for <i>Tape Op's</i> online presence that I had done for his studio. Well, such is life’s reliable serendipity. A month later, I was the magazine's first online publisher.</p>

        <p>To be clear: the state of <i>Tape Op's</i> online presence was that it had no online presence. Or at least, not really. It had a phpBB messageboard that had enjoyed substantial traffic in the early aughts, but was rapidly sliding out of view in the shadow of the emerging Web 2.0 era.</p>

        <p>Editorially, there was nothing. <i>Tape Op's</i> content existed exclusively on good old ink and paper, delivered via USPS. Meanwhile, around us, the landscape was shifting. People were reading their media online. Venerable newspapers were closing. Every major magazine was sinking millions into phone and tablet apps. Brick-and-mortar music superstores like Tower and Virgin were getting clobbered by iTunes and friends.</p> 

         <p>I donned my inaugural hat in the publishing world with the same question haunting every other publication at the time: <i>could</i> a magazine survive the digital age, and if so, then <i>how?</i></p>

        <h3>Editorial Website</h3>

        <p>In 2011, everyone who worked in media was in a frenzy over apps. Particularly iOS apps.</p>

        <p>Apple had dropped the first iPad directly on the publishing world's head the year before, and it was reacting accordingly. Everything felt as if it were a doomsday and a utopian second coming all at once. All the big magazines were putting out these ultra high-end tablet apps with sweeping interactive layouts and sumptuous animations. All the tiny magazines were digging their heels in and championing the perenial value of print. They had watched indie record stores flourish while their corporate megastore contemporaries became ghost town warehouses overnight, and were banking on a similar trend.</p>

        <p>Was the printed page dead? <i>Print was dead!</i> Or was it? Everyone had a strong opinion but no one really had any idea.</p>
