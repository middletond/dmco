        <h2 class="center">Building an <b>online presence</b> for the world's most <b>beloved magazine</b> about <b>recording music.</b></h2>

        <figure class="image large">

        </figure>

         <p class="big"><span class="lead">In my early 20s,</span> aside from all the usual early 20s things, I was fumbling and groping my way through a nascent career in music production. Sometimes during this period I would manage to swallow my pride and solicit career advise from smarter, cooler, more established musicians. The more I did this, the more I noticed a common imperative:</p>
         <p class="big"><i>"Do you read Tape Op?"</i></p>
         <p class="big"><i>"You really should be reading Tape Op."</i></p>
         <p class="big"><i>"When I started out, I read every issue of <i>Tape Op</i> I could get my hands on."</i></p>
         <p class="big"><i>"You just have to work your ass off. But also, be sure to subscribe to Tape Op."</i></p>

         <p>It turned out <i>Tape Op</i> was a bi-monthly magazine utterly devoted to recording music. It was founded by John Baccigaluppi and Larry Crane, two working-class, west-coast recording engineers with well-known bodies of work, and despite feeling incredibly home-grown (which it was), it had the largest circulation of any magazine of its kind.</p>

         <h4><span>The Anti Rolling Stone</span></h4>

         <p>Each issue of <i>Tape Op</i> was an ardent love letter to the craft disguised as a dense trade publication. Celebrity readers like Pete Townsend and Trent Reznor elbowed out space in the letters section alongside unknown kids recording songs in their bedroom to weigh in on and debate particulars of the profession. Its centerpiece was sprawling, spontaneous, conversational interviews with music industry professionals ranging from glaringly famous to quietly obscure. These interviews &mdash; full of humanizing tangents and random bursts of effusive technical talk &mdash; functioned sort of like an anti-<i>Rolling Stone</i>; instead of taking individuals and transmuting them into larger-than-life cultural icons, <i>Tape Op</i> took unimpeachable superstars of the musical world and made them normal people. You'd read an article and say, "They're excited about that same crappy $100 piece of equipment I just bought. They're talking about all the times they completely fucked up a project. They just spent half the interview trading anecdotes about their cats."</p>

         <p>A clear message arose from repeated readings: <i>we were all the same.</i> We were all wide-eyed, nerdy kids astonished and in love with the magic of sound, and the profound emotions it could stir in us. Once every two months, <i>Tape Op</i> provided us a communal place to gather and gush.</p>

         <h4><span>Serendipity, etc.</span></h4>

         <p>By the time I moved from my hometown of Boston to settle in Sacramento, I had been visiting this communal place for years. When I offered to build a website (my first, though I omitted this fact) for the sweet, jovial owner of the recording studio I had begun working out of, I had no I idea I was talking to <i>Tape Op's</i> publisher, John Baccigaluppi. Later, when that studio website thing had played out surprisingly well and I did find out who he was, the fanboy in me was still reeling when John asked if I could do the same thing for <i>Tape Op's</i> online presence that I had done for his studio.</p>

        <p>Uhh...maybe? I have no idea? Probably not? I said yes.</p>

         <h4><span>State of the Union</span></h4>

        <p>The current state of <i>Tape Op's</i> online presence was that it had no online presence. Or at least, not really. It had an old school messageboard that had enjoyed substantial traffic in the early aughts, but was rapidly sliding out of view in the shadow of the emerging Web 2.0 era.</p>

        <p>Editorially, there was nothing. <i>Tape Op's</i> content existed exclusively on good old ink and paper, delivered via USPS. Meanwhile, around us, the landscape was shifting. People were reading their media online. Venerable newspapers were closing. Every major magazine was sinking millions into phone and tablet apps. Brick-and-mortar music superstores like Tower and Virgin were getting clobbered by iTunes.</p>

         <p>My initial question was the same one haunting everyone else in the publishing world at the time: <i>could</i> a magazine survive the digital age, and if so, then <i>how?</i></p>

        <h3>Editorial Website</h3>

        <p>In 2011, everyone who worked in media was in a frenzy over apps. Particularly iOS apps.</p>

        <p>Apple had dropped the first iPad directly on the publishing world's head the year before, and it was reacting accordingly. Everything felt as if it were a doomsday and a utopian second coming all at once. All the big magazines were putting out these ultra high-end tablet apps with sweeping interactive layouts and sumptuous animations. All the tiny magazines were digging their heels in and championing the perennial value of print (they had watched indie record stores flourish while their corporate megastore contemporaries became ghost town warehouses overnight, and were banking on a similar trend). No matter who you were though, you were concerned about radical change and survival.</p>

        <h4>Fear of Pirates</h4>

        <p>What no one appeared to be doing at the time was moving their editorial content directly to their website. I blame in part the current app craze (you may fondly remember that period when someone blurted out, "there's an app for that!" at least once in every conversation), but there was more to it than that. The era of free content, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRSi_P2cU6M">Thank You Economy</a>, and certainly creator-subscriber relationship services like Patreon were nascent at best. Having come to stature during the printed word, most publishers viewed their content as one would material goods: they would be stolen at the first opportunity, and once stolen they would never again be paid for. The only reason the public did not flagrantly steal magazines and books was because there was not a safe, easy, and effective means to do so. From this lens, the internet was a terrifying place.</p>

        <p>This helped to explain the industry's rabid rush to create iPad apps for each of their magazines. On its face the motivation appeared to simply be that an iPad looked and felt very much like a magazine, and so we finally possessed a rich, full-color (sorry 2011 Kindle), recline-in-chair-after-long-day sort of digital reading experience comparable to ink-and-paper counterparts.</p>

        <p>Yet such capability had already existed on the web for years. Moreover, a toe-in-water foray into mobile app development revealed a lumbering deployment process fraught with headaches. Updates to code could take two to three <i>weeks</i> to go live, and if anything wasn't to Apple's liking after that time, they could simply reject the updates. Comparative to this, web publishing was unbelievably nimble. Updates were a <code>git push</code> away. So why on earth not simply just publish to the web?</p>

        <p>Fear of theft. Publishing via Apple's closed app ecosystem removed the threat of internet piracy. You couldn't copy the text. You couldn't copy the images. You could possibly share, but only through means regulated by the app itself. Basically, everything that made Apple's haters hate, made publishers see them as their greatest hope.</p>

        <p>So was this concern real, or just delusion and paranoia? I unsheathed google and attempted some research.</p>

        <p>My conclusion was that these fears were indeed founded, but <i>only if you were a true behemoth of a company</i>. I couldn't find a single case where companies smaller than a Coca-cola or Microsoft didn't benefit hugely from so-called piracy. Basically, when it came to content-based products, the average loss from piracy was <i>always</i> less than the visibility and consequent customers gained in free advertising. Everyone wanted to "go viral," but going viral was predicated on content that was rapidly sharable. Premium, protected content &mdash; i.e.  the <i>best</i> content &mdash; was always under some sort of lock and key; the only way to make it shareable was to steal it.</b>

        <p>I decided that mobile apps simply weren't worth it for small publishers. To hell with "rich, interactive multimedia experiences." We would focus on delivering to the digital world what we already knew and were already good at: simple text and images. This is what the web was made for.</p>

        <blockquote><p>I couldn't find a single case where companies smaller than a Coca-cola or Microsoft didn't <b>benefit hugely from so-called piracy.</b></p></blockquote>

        <p>I also didn't buy that the public of the future would be entirely consumed by video and multimedia. Yes, video &mdash; when done <i>well</i> &mdash; was amazing and uniquely engrossing. And <i>clearly</i> increased video consumption by the public was inevitable. But magazine publishers <i>didn't know how to make good videos</i>. Moreover, my observations had been that people still cherished the written word. They weren't abandoning <i>reading</i>; they were abandoning <i>paper</i>.</p>

        <p>I made my pitch to John and Larry and it was decided: a good article delivered simply beat a mediocre multimedia experience delivered with the latest fad. Web piracy had no real teeth. We were putting 15 years of content on the web.</p>

        <h4>Moving to the Responsive Web</h4>

        <h3>Unified Subscriptions</h3>

        <p>So was the printed page dead? <i>Print was dead!</i> Or was it? Everyone had a strong opinion but no one really had any idea.</p>

        <h4>Lifeboats vs. Vampires</h4>

        <p>The answer to this question mattered to us quite a lot. If indeed there was an impending Printed Paper Apocalypse, our digital magazine could serve as our lifeboat, allowing our articles, subscribers, and entire ecosystem to bail off the old sinking ship and land in the digital realm to continue business as usual. On the other hand, if print stayed strong, there was concern that an overly strong digital presence would actually hurt us. </p>

        <p>This is because the lifeblood of the magazine came from print ads from audio companies, most of which were run by old school music industry veterans (if images of grey hair slicked back in pony tails and cigar puffing flooded your mind, yes, you nailed it). Almost all of these people profoundly distrusted any advertising medium that had to do with computers and www’s and things you couldn’t hold in your hands.<p>

        <p>There was also a problem with how circulation numbers translated from print to online. From a sales standpoint, it took about ten online visitors to equal a single print magazine reader. i.e. when presenting numbers to potential advertisers, 10,000 print subscribers carried about as much weight as 100,000 online visitors. If a bunch of our readers dropped their print subscription for the convenience of online reading, the loss to the old medium would be 10x the gain to the new medium, which the folks we sold to didn’t even trust.</p>

        <p>In other words, it could suck the blood right out of us.</p>

        <p>To me, it seemed like there must be a <i>third way</i>. How could we have our cake and eat it too? How could we make it so that more online traffic always meant more print traffic?</p>

        <h4>United We Stand</h4>

        <p>One of the flagship facts about <i>Tape Op</i> subscriptions is that they are always free to readers. All our revenue came from advertising dollars. This was frequently met with raised eyebrows from the rest of the publishing industry, but it worked because of the particular fervency of our readers: a single new subscriber was almost certain to be a deeply serious music recordist, who was very likely to purchase thousands of dollars of recording equipment over their lifetime. So, one subscriber's eyeballs on our print magazine was worth more to us in advertising than the cost of postage to send it to them.</p>

        <!-- <p>One of the flagship facts about <i>Tape Op</i> subscriptions is that they are always free to readers. All our revenue came from advertising dollars. This was frequently met with raised eyebrows from the rest of the publishing industry, but here's how it worked:</p> -->

        <!-- <p>More subscribers meant a higher bill from the post office, but it also meant our ads reached more eyeballs. This meant we were more valuable to our advertisers. Okay, but <i>how</i> much more valuable? Valuable enough to outweigh the costs of increased postage? In our case, <i>yes</i>. <i>Tape Op's</i> audience was very specific and highly devoted &mdash; a single new subscriber is almost certain to be a deeply serious music recordist, who is very likely to purchase thousands of dollars of recording equipment over their lifetime. One more paper magazine delivered by USPS bulk mail, on the other hand, required a trivially small increase in effort by the post office. Could a larger, more generalized publication do this? Probably not. A single new subscriber doesn't mean that much when the subject matter is less focused or the readers less fervent.</p>

        <p>The bottom line here is that one subscriber reading our print magazine was worth more to us than the cost to send it to them. So long as we could maintain this positive margin, the magazine could flourish. If we somehow lost or diluted our appeal to our readers, that margin would collapse.</p> -->

        <p>I realized that this fact would allow us to do something unusual: we could mail readers print magazines as casually as we sent them digital content. As long as our readership was filled with passionate recordists, it wouldn't feel invasive, and was no fiscal loss to us. And if we could do this, <i>we could make a unified subscription experience that was the same for everybody</i>.</p>

        <p>The unified subscription flow would ask for your email, a password, and an optional mailing address, and then subscribe you. No matter what, you could then read our content online, and receive new "digital issues" in your inbox (a simple PDF). If you gave us your mailing address, we would also mail you print magazines. I reasoned that very few readers would opt out of the mailing address because, hey, free magazine devoted to your favorite topic. To me, it didn't feel spammy; it felt like a personal gift.</p>

        <p>This meant that every time <i>Tape Op</i> got a new subscriber, <i>both</i> our print and online circulation would go up.</p>

        <p>Yes. This was the third way. I got to building.</p>

        <h4>Simple Is Good</h4>

        <p>This ended up benefiting us in all sorts of ways. The PR was awesome, as in an industry where print circulation was falling across the board, ours was actually <i>rising</i>. Our readers got a much better user experience, with a single, simple subscription flow and one clear opt-out option that could be ignored without hassle. Our old-world advertisers were also satisfied &mdash; the percentage of readers that opted out of print delivery was extremely small, and even when they did, the fact that readers received a PDF in their inboxes that <i>looked</i> identical to the printed magazine seemed to be enough for them.</p>
