        <p class="big">These are narrations of some past professional experiences. They are mostly my attempt to sort through the general daily blur of problem-solving (more commonly known as "work"), and hopefully pick out some larger lessons. A <i>portfolio</i>, if you will.</p>

                  <hr />
                  <p>
                      From 2011 to 2017, I was the online publisher and CTO of the largest circulated publication about music recording in the world. The magazine was beloved in the print industry, but had little online presence, nor any concept of how to venture into that world successfully. At the beginning of my time there, I didn't either.

                      The Mill is a Sacramento makers shop that designs and builds modern, artful custom furniture with reclaimed materials and an industrial flair. I helped them connect to the larger world by designing and building a marketing website, doing a bunch of photography, and working with them on creating a pitch perfect brand.

                  <p>
                      Margaret Welty is a California-born artist and college educator who is on a mission to bring the deep benefits of regular creative visual expression to everyone in the world. She is a long-time client for whom I have played many roles. When I first met her, she was full of enthusiasm and ideas, but was unsure how to funnel them into a cohesive and effective platform.

                  <p>
                      If you've ever had to research public records, you know the story is almost always the same: while they are <i>technically available</i> to the public, they sure aren't very <i>actionable</i>. I've spent much of the past few years attempting to help remedy this problem using the technological wonders of the modern web. Here are the highlights.
