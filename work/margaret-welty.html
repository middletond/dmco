        <h2 class="center">Helping an artist to <b>change how we think about drawing</b> and empower us to <b>create original art without fear.</b></h2>

         <p class="big"><span class="lead">Margaret Welty has long imagined</span> a different world. Growing up in California as a natural and passionate visual artist, she quickly developed a successful career as both a painter / sculptor and a college educator. To her, the profound benefits of artistic creation were self-evident and always accessible.</p>

         <p>Yet, as she waded deeper into the educational side of her career, she found these benefits to be not only unknown to the general public, but actively restricted &mdash; in our society, only <i>"Capital A Artistes"</i> were allowed to make art. To Margaret, this was heartbreaking, and since then she has made it her lifeâ€™s mission to annihilate these barriers, and help usher in a world where everyday folks draw, paint, and express themselves through art as freely as they speak, write, and converse.</p>

         <p>When I first encountered Margaret, she was an enthusiastic and loquacious individual full of budding versions of these ideas, but without a clear sense of how to convert them into a cohesive and effective platform. I worked with her distill and clarify her brand, churn out a bunch of foundational materials and assets, and build up a central platform from which to engage it all with the world.</p>

        <h3>Hub Website</h3>

        <p>When I began working with her, Margaret had her hands in a lot of endeavors.</p>

        <p>Among other things, she was presenting at national and regional art educator's conferences, creating tutorial videos for online students across the world, teaching in sought-after college classes, doing radio and podcast interviews, and creating new art work. She had a number of small websites already, each attending to one of these pieces.</p>

        <p>Though I understood the intention behind this approach, I observed that in practice it 1) was too much for her to maintain and keep track of, and 2) created confusion and cloudiness around the core ideas that she wanted to deliver to the world. If someone wanted to know what she was "all about," it wasn't clear where to send them. When she did an interview, it wasn't clear which URL to promote.

        <p>It seemed to me if we could unify all these things under one digital roof, that would give her the firm ground upon which she could begin truly expanding her reach.</p>

        <h4><span>The Pain (and Power) of Priorities</span></h4>

        <p>One of my favorite parts of building a hub website is that it forces you &mdash; often through highly gritted teeth  &mdash; to define and prioritize the key aspects of both your brand and your business objectives. After a lengthy brainstorm, Margaret settled on her three most important goals in the next two to three years:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Build a list of folks who resonate with her content and ideas</li>
          <li>Get more folks watching her tutorial videos</li>
          <li>Book more in-person workshops</li>
        </ol>

        <p>These principles helped immensely to guide me towards clear, punchy headlines and messaging, and site flow that was always softly carrying users towards one of our three desired actions.</p>

        </figure>

        <h4><span>Design Principles &amp; Aesthetics</span></h4>

        <p> In her tutorial videos, Margaret would speak in a stream-of-consciousness flow, taking lofty, complex-seeming fine art techniques and gently transmuting them into simple, almost child-like practices. Drawing became less a rigorous craft, and more a therapy, a release, a meditation. She would take her viewers back to how they felt about making art when they were young: as an act of curiosity, wonder, and exploration.</p>

        <p>I really wanted to to successfully infuse these qualities into her site and brand, but without receding into something that might be mistaken for Sesame Street. To achieve this, I started with bold, blocky colors and smatters of DIY line drawings and collages lifted from her tutorials, then contained it with tight, economic verbiage and generous whitespace.</p>

        <p>Ideally, the site felt concise and professional, but also full of joy and playfulness.</p>

      <h3>Workshops</h3>

      <p>Margaret's methodologies, tools, and ideas about learning art had long been applicable to a much wider demographic than just college students. While her college classes were one of her core passions, she really wanted to move beyond the administrative and geographic confines of the institution she worked for, and begin delivering curriculums in person for other groups.</p>

      <p>Because of her passion for the subject, Margaret had an infectious energy and an innate gift for speaking extemporaneously for almost any length of time when she began teaching. My sense was she would be a natural at presenting art workshops in almost any environment to almost any crowd. Moreoever, I felt she would love delivering doing it, and her audiences would love her.</p>

      <p>So, in early 2017 we began developing workshop ideas to put out there and see what happened.</p>

      <p>Margaret also applied for more formalized presentation spots at the annual <a href="https://www.arteducators.org/" target="_blank">Art Education Association</a> conferences in San Francisco and Seattle. To our great excitement, she was accepted to both!</p>

      <p>Over the next months, I worked with Margaret to help create, develop, and polish each workshop. Unlike our independent workshops, these presentations had defined parameters with a more traditional academic bent. For the national workshop in Seattle, we created <i>Art + Math: Using Measurements to Map Your Own Face</i>, which taught attendees how to use the scientific method and household items to better understand and draw the human face with accurate proportions. Once it was properly organized, I created a <a href="/assets/img/work/mw/naea.pdf" target="_blank">printed version</a> to hand out to attendees.</p>

      <p>The state-level workshop in the Bay Area was more broadly themed, so we took a different approach. We filmed repeated passes of Margaret improvising a lesson (creating low-stakes abstract art with colored pencils to freely explore the classical elements of design), then reviewed the footage and assembled a presentation from the best moments in all of them. As a bonus, we found that the abstract drawings she had made during the lesson passes worked really well as posters to hang in the presentation room.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://margaretwelty.com/testimonials/#workshops" target="_blank">feedback from workshop attendees</a> was very encouraging, and emboldened Margaret to continue pursuing opportunities to deliver her material. Since that time she has begun to deliver fully independent workshops across a wide spectrum of demographics.</p>
