        <h2 class="center">It was high time their <b>online brand caught up</b> with them.</h2>

        <p class="big"><span class="lead">Look, I get it: we live in a world</span> overstuffed with superlatives. Okay, now let me tell you about one of the most amazing meals I've ever tasted.</p>

        <p class="big">It was approaching the holidays in Sacramento and I was at the home of Russ and Linda Landers, owners of <i>the Hidden Table</i>, a fast-rising, local, farm-to-fork catering company. I'm at their house this evening because once a month, Russ and Linda prepare and serve a meal&mdash;called a "private tasting"&mdash;in their own dining room for prospective new customers. This particular gathering consisted of about a dozen people. Most were young couples flushed from recent engagement, along with the occasional parent, and the rest were some nice university folks from UC Davis.</p>

        <p class="big">Oh, and also: me. Russ and Linda had signed with me that day to perform a website and brand overhaul, and Russ had graciously invited me to a tasting so that I could, ahem, <i>do brand research</i>.</p>

        <p>Though they had just become official clients, I had first met Russ several years prior, when the company was just pushing off the ground. Since then, much had transpired. He and Linda married, she had ditched a 20-year corporate career and signed on as CEO, and the company had steadily expanded based on effusive word of mouth. More recently, this expansion had substantially picked up speed. Russ and Linda were elated about the growth spurt, but were also holding on for dear life.</p>

        <p>Arriving at their home, I found Russ’ demeanor identical to when I met him. An Oklahoma native, his quick wit was tempered by a midwesterner's easy, warm directness. He used the word "blessed" often, and without irony. He explained things using baseball metaphors. He made you feel part of his team. It would take a serious act of will not to like him immediately.</p>

        <h4>A Web Designer's Guide to Amazing Free Food</h4>

        <p>I had no dog in the upcoming-event race, so my presence became an object of curiosity. I spent the pre-meal minutes attempting to explain away my imposter syndrome feelings to the other guests. <i>You are here because you're going to re-design a website? Why exactly is eating the food necessary for such a thing?</i>  I did my best to champion the pricelessness of first-hand personal experience with your clients’ craft, but I think most of them concluded I was simply a culinary freeloader.</p>

        <p>Well, perhaps I was. As Russ and his team began dishing out entrees, it became apparent I had hit the culinary freeloader jackpot.</p>

            <h2 class="center"><b>All signs point to deliciousness.</b> <br />Chef Russ + guests wind up for a Hidden Table private tasting.</h2>
        </figure>

        <p>I am not a food writer, so I'll spare you watching me struggle through descriptions. You can always <a href="https://thehiddentablegourmet.com/menus/" target="_blank">ogle Russ's dishes yourself</a>. There are, though, a couple things about the experience that I think I can depict successfully.</p>

        <p>First, this was not a restaurant meal, per se. It was more akin to a home-cooked meal. But like, a really, <i>really</i> good home-cooked meal made by your favorite uncle who happens to be a badass five-star chef. There is some dining that makes you stress over whether you're sitting up straight enough, or pronouncing the choices correctly, or if the other diners are secretly judging your attire. This was not that kind of dining. Eating this meal felt like coming home. It evoked words in me like <i>nourishing</i>, <i>satisfying</i>, <i>fresh</i>, <i>rewarding</i>. This is the food you would want to eat in your PJs after a long day surrounded by your closest loved ones. A full-tilt, no-holds-barred, <i>rest-and-digest</i> experience.</p>

        <p>Second was the staff. Despite this being a normal dining room in a normal house, there was a palpable sense of service and humility that infused the room, and it was because of them. Their body languages reminded me of the guards at the gates of Buckingham palace. They seemed to treat it more like delivering a sacrament than performing a job.</p>

        <p>To consider that this is the experience the Hidden Table brought to gatherings of hundreds every week was striking. I left feeling moved, impressed, and inspired.</p>

        <!-- <h4>New Websites: Are They Even Still A Thing?</h4>

        <p>The Hidden Table needed a new website. Wait. Did the Hidden Table need a new website? Weren't they totally crushing it already? What was the reason for this again? Was this just me making up justifications so I could satisfy my heaving and raging <i>must-make-everything-prettier-and-shiner</i> compulsions?</p>

        <p>This is a question worth exploring.</p> -->

        <h3><span>Brand Website</span></h3>

        <p>When it comes to online presence, entropy is often your biggest enemy.</p>

        <p>One of the more horrifying yet diverting pastimes for web designer is to compare the versions of the designs an agency shows in their portfolio versus what the actual site looks like. The more in the past the re-design was, the more you can see how the real life site has decayed. Blog indexes become ghost towns.</p>

        <p>Yet again, the second law of thermodynamics has challenged someone and won.</p>

        <h4>The Hidden Problem</h4>

        <p>It’s not rocket science why this happens. Digital content creation is an annoying monkey on the back of every business owner. Like transcendental meditation or calling your grandparents, it is  just this thing you know you should do but don’t really know how to do and feel guilty and anxious over not doing enough. Where are you supposed to find time to write blog posts? And what the hell is a snapchat? Are agencies going to start insisting the only way to stay competitive in your market is to regularly post pics of yourself with anime eyes and fox ears?</p>

        <!-- <p>This is definitely not what you signed up for. Your digital marketing agency tells you content and social media marketing are like, the most important thing. And they just made you a gorgeous new website, not to mention they are the experts, so you trust them. Even though you still don’t quite know how SEO works.</p> -->

        <p>Yet this is the deal. All digital agencies sustain themselves with the same pitch: "If you don’t do this hot new online thing, your business will perish. Oh, you don’t have the bandwidth to do that? Ah, what a fortunate coincidence—we are actually total experts at doing this new thing! We can do it for you! Well, thank goodness we found you before it was too late."</p>

        <blockquote><p><b>Digital content creation</b> is an annoying monkey on the back of <b>every business owner.</b></p></blockquote>

        <figure class="image small">
            <img src="/assets/img/work/tht/pages_home.png" />
        </figure>

        <p>For bigger businesses this is all fine. They have the resources, and—perhaps more importantly—the existing habits. They already have teams dedicated to concerns unrelated to their core competencies. They already have offices for accounting and legal; why not another for digital content?</p>

        <p>But what about smaller businesses? Family-run businesses? This is a different model. For these folks, it is: live and breathe your core competency every waking hour, then somehow get to the other required stuff in the mostly non-existent spaces in between. There is no “digital content team” for these folks. Moreover, they don’t have the resources to hire a full-blown outside agency.</p>

        <p>Of all the companies I have worked with, the Hidden Table were <i>the most</i> like this.</p>

        <figure class="image small">
            <img src="/assets/img/work/tht/cooking.jpg" />
            <h2 class="center"><b>The focus required to fill 300 bellies.</b><br />Chef Russ and his team in action.</h2>
        </figure>

        <p>The Hidden Table's office was a place of action. Whenever I meet with Russ and Linda, I always find them cartwheeling through what appear to be at least three crises in parallel. Here's a typical scene: Linda is both on the phone with a customer, and orchestrating her entire team. The tone of her voice in is constant oscillation. She looks up from the phone to address me with taciturn frankness, before switching on a dime to a personable warmth as she returns to helping her customer navigate the touchy logistics of successfully feeding her wedding reception's 250 guests. Russ, meanwhile, has a phone wedged to his ear while he types on two laptops, and occasionally barks orders like a field commander. Their staff is in the back, careening everywhere like balls in an 80's pinball machine. There are a lot of ingredients flying around. There is also lots of running and shouting, in general. If enemy troops suddenly barged in and shells started exploding around us, it wouldn’t have felt all that weird.</p>

        <p>It was clear to me that the work the Hidden Table did was all-consuming, and they were deadly serious about being consumed by it. It was also clear to me that asking these guys to maintain their own online content would be clinically insane. If ever there was an online ghost town waiting to happen, it was here.</p>

        <h3><span>An Automated Content Machine</span></h3>

        <figure class="image small">
            <img src="/assets/img/work/tht/automatic.jpg" />
        </figure>

        <!-- <p>You may or may not know, dear reader, that every web-based project begins with a “discovery” phase. This is basically the period where the agency asks the client enough questions to ensure the work they do is actually the right work. It generally includes things like inquiries into client workflows, pain points, customers, plus market research on competitors. Typically, no designing happens until this phase is complete.</p>

        <p>Here is a graph illustrating how my view on the importance of this phase has changed over time.</p>

        <p>[ discovery phase graph ]</p>

        <p>There are many reasons behind this trend, and would necessitate a separate article, nay, probably a whole separate book, but let me focus on a single big one. The key insights to solve a project’s biggest technical problems are almost always found by learning more about your client. That is to say: if you want the most elegant solutions, search for new plugins less and bother your business owners more.</p>

        <p>The Hidden Table was a textbook case of this. It was clear to me after watching their daily tornados of office activity that these were not people who would update their website content. Sure, it seemed likely that they would eventually scale up enough to hire a dedicated content marketing person, but to me that seemed at least two to three years away. And it just wasn’t where their heads were at. They talked about wanting to have an admin area "just in case" they wanted to update things, but I knew from experience they would never get it. Nor, perhaps, should they. They weren’t in the tech business, after all.</p> -->

        <p>Okay. So. How do you make a fresh, lively web presence for folks that are living in perpetual redline each and every day? I could see the writing on the wall with the traditional agency "built you an awesome web presence" package: at launch time everything rolls out with shiny, up-to-date content, then one year later it looks like a Detroit automobile factory.</p>

        <p>The Hidden Table did do this <i>one online thing</i>: every time they served food at an event, their staff snapped pictures. Afterward, they posted them to the company's Facebook page. They didn’t do <i>any</i> other social media, but they did do this.</p>

        <p>This tiny behavior became the seed for all my plans.</p>

        <p>These photos were unstaged, often low-resolution, and taken by hardscrabble caterers, not photographers—taken individually, it would be rare to find one that would seem appropriate for a glossy brand website. But viewed in their aggregate, they conveyed a remarkably rich, 100% <a href="https://thehiddentablegourmet.com/events/" target="_blank">organic portrait</a> of what Russ, Linda, and their staff actually do.</p>

        <figure class="image medium">
            <img src="/assets/img/work/tht/screens_phones.png" />
        </figure>

        <p>With the right presentation, I felt these loose bundles of candid shots could tell the Hidden Table's story with more clarity and emotional impact than any set of glossy, staged, close-up photos of food ever could.</p>

        <h4>Using All Parts of the Animal</h4>

        <p>Between event photos and customer reviews, it seemed to me the Hidden Table's presence on Facebook could fuel close to the entirety of their website content. And it could do so in a way that would be more compelling and more authentic than any kind of staged or curated thing. This was <i>literally them</i>, in <i>real time</i>.</p>

        <p>We could have an events page which would group and display photos by event, along with the date, location, and Russ’ in-the-moment comment from his original post. We could also separate out the photos from events, tag them as either people or food, and have both food and people (e.g. their staff) pages full of authentic images. It would be a clean historical record of all of their professional activity, told as visual stories.</p>

        <p>We could also power a reviews page using with the latest customer posts from both Facebook and Yelp, sorted by most recent.</p>

        <blockquote><p><b>Social content</b> wasn't just going to <i>support</i> the website. It was <b>going to <i>be</i> the website.</b></p></blockquote>

        <figure class="image large">
            <img src="/assets/img/work/tht/tablets.png" />
        </figure>

        <p>Okay, so this is all very good. But how do we <i>do</i> this? A key factor here is that this content plan would only work with <i>the right presentation</i>. This means no little embed widgets or something equally tacky. We weren’t going to put like a plucky little facebook post feed in the sidebar or the footer or something. </p>

        <p>Social content wasn't going to <i>support</i> the website; it was going to <i>be</i> the website.</p>

        <h4>The Technical Bits: APIs vs. Web Scraping</h4>

        <p>I'm going to speak in geek language for a bit here. Feel free to skip this section if you feel your eyes glazing over.</p>

        <p>To make this happen, the developers among you may have assumed the use of Yelp's and Facebook's official APIs. This would be quite reasonable of you. This is certainly my preferred way to pull in content. Unfortunately,  API's often have enforced limits. And hey, we like limits. Limits are good for humankind. Humans need structure and boundaries. That said, sometimes those boundaries can be real dealbreaker sonsabitches. </p>

        <p>First there's Yelp. Yelp’s API only returns the first three reviews for a given business, and on top of that gives them to you in some sort of "Yelp secret sauce" ordering. Of course, we wanted <i>all</i> the Yelp reviews, ordered by <i>most recent</i>. Hmph.</p>

        <p>Okay, what about Facebook? Facebook’s API limits were more subtle, but also more maddening. Facebook would only allow substantive API access to a business page if the requestor was logged in. Moreover, they go to great lengths to make sure that <i>only human beings</i> can log in. Okay, that's sensible. No bots. Except... for this project, I wanted a bot. A bot made the most sense, both for us and for Facebook. The bot would pull Facebook content into a back end and store it in a database. Then, the Hidden Table website could query <i>that</i>. Otherwise, the site would we forced to constantly bother Facebook for the same data every time it got a new visitor.</p>

        <p>Doesn't that seem like the polite, sensible approach? After a bunch of banging away in the terminal, though, it was clear Facebook did not agree. Yeesh.</p>

        <p>So now what? Frustrated failure? Not quite. Fortunately, there is web scraping.</p>

        <p>Ah, web scraping. That shady, cigarette-smoking cousin of the well-documented API. Nothing makes you feel like an web developer vigilante quite so much as programmatically scraping content from mungy HTML. </p>

        <figure class="image small">
            <h2 class="center alt">The automated content machine<br /> version zero:</h2>
            <img src="/assets/img/work/tht/content_machine.jpg" />
        </figure>

        <p>I think web scraping gets a bad rap. I was in a <a href="https://vigilant.cc" target="_blank">civic data tech startup</a> and I headed up data ingestion for a couple years. Day in and out, our job was to pull official records out of government websites, by hook or by crook. We did a lot of API work, but we did even more scraping. </p>

        <p>As the data sources piled up, I noticed that on average the API-driven sources went awry significantly more often than the web scraping ones. I found this both astonishing and counterintuitive&mdash;many of these government sites looked like they were built in 1997, with decaying, brittle markup to match. Yet, it continued to be so, even beyond the scope of the startup. </p>

        <p>That said, I had never before scraped social media. Would it be different? I was fairly confident I could build a working system <i>today</i>, but would it continue to work over the <i>next few years?</i> Especially the ever-shifting code-and-policy monster that is Facebook. But hey, history was on my side.</p>

        <h4>Assembling the Machine</h4>

        <p>The Yelp side of things was straightforward. Yelp's business reviews page is by the book&mdash;semantic HTML, no javascript rendering. I have a <i>de novo</i> scraping library that I've steadily whittled down to the essentials, so there was little infrastructure to set up. If a web page is well-structured, I can be pulling in the desired data in minutes.</p>

        <p>Facebook was, of course, not that. Facebook's pages were an opaque jungle of shifting, javascript-rendered, hyper-nested elements. Most of this was surmountable with the right tools&mdash;the javascript can be handled with a headless browser, and the dense nesting with some well-placed pharmacological stimulants&mdash;but the shifting thing was a real problem. Every time you reloaded the page, <i>the structure, ids, and class names changed</i>. This was perhaps solvable in theory, but solvable in the time budget allotted for a marketing website for a local catering company? Not so much.</p>

        <p>Fortunately, like any Achilles-like figure, Facebook had a heel. Err, actually more like an progessive, beneficial service to the developing world. But for our purposes, also a heel.</p>

        <p>In 2011, Facebook had deployed a service called <a href="https://mbasic.facebook.com" target="_blank">Mobile Basic</a>. The service aimed to shrink the global accessibility gap to social media by delivering core Facebook pages to the most rudimentary of cellphones. As such, these pages were delivered in <i>blissfully semantic, javacript-free HTML</i>.</p>

        <p>I was, as one might expect, quite happy to discover Facebook Mobile Basic. I loved the idea as an accessiblity template for any global tech platform. I am a big believer in simple, semantic HTML. At the end of the day, most people don't care about glossy javascript animations. They just want to be on the platform. Rather than try to make your product do everything for everyone, build an entirely separate, low-res, no-frills product that you almost never have to worry about or retool.</p>

        <p>And oh hey: <i>it also allowed Facebook business page data to be painlessly scraped.</i></p>

        <p>I was philosophically aligned to both of these new facts.</p>

        <p>The ability to scrape the canonical public Facebook activity of a business seemed like it might be useful generally, so I decided to abstract the concept. I created a module that accepts a Facebook business page URL, and returns the entirety of posts, reviews, and photos for that business as structured JSON data. From there, I set up an ongoing social media content pipeline for the Hidden Table ending in a permanent data store, and an API service on top.</p>

        <p>This might've seemed like a lot of labor in the short term, but the approach had some serious long-term benefits:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><b>The client owns the core front-facing content of their business.</b> No matter what happens to social media in the future, the Hidden Table retains a complete and easy-to-access library of all posts, reviews, and photos&mdash;the essence of who they are online.</li>

          <li><b>The client's content isn't bound to their website.</b> They can change platforms, redesign the site and / or have multiple sites, all without the labor and stress having to re-architect, transfer, and translate content.</li>

          <li><b>The client doesn't have to manually update anything.</b> Pertinent new content appears automatically on their website. Their site never becomes a ghost town. Their online footprint is consistently relevant. They can focus on what they do best.</li>

          <li><b>The client's website doesn't need an admin area.</b> We can build the website without being limited to platforms with a built-in, client-friendly admin. This means we can build lightning-fast, performant pages using with something like Jekyll instead of something slow and potentially bloated like Wordpress.</li>
        </ol>

    <h3><span>Design & Branding</span></h3>

    <p>I want to talk about design, but to do that I need talk about market research, because for me the former to utterly rooted in the latter. My research approach is pretty structured, and consists of three prongs:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>Skyscraper method.</b> A real estate trick. Go into a city and find the tallest skyscrapers. Then build yours 20 stories higher. Except, you know, with websites. Either way, formulating a set point based on your best competitors is foundational to standing out from them.</li>

      <li><b>Go swimming with the big fish.</b> Within your client's sector, find the top companies in the hottest markets on the planet and study their websites for inspiration and and ideas. Find things we resonate with, and consider how to adopt them for our purposes.</li>

      <li><b>Look outside your circle.</b> Identify industries, crafts, or businesses you feel a kinship with outside of your own, and look for design elements, language, or ways of doing things that you like. Add these in as flavors / spices into your own brand. This is a very effective way to "escape the herd" and communicate&mdash;subtlely or otherwise&mdash;that this company is different.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This is my favorite part of the process. Aside from face-to-face conversations, I am convinced this is the most mission critical thing that happens when building a website. For every client I work with I go through all three of these and, thus far, it always seems to make things turn out well.</p>

    <figure class="image medium">
      <h2 class="center"><b>One of my fave photos dug up from social media.</b> Chef Russ grills up locally sourced veggies at an event.</h2>
      <img src="/assets/img/work/tht/veggies.jpg" />
    </figure>

    <p>So I dug into phase one with the Hidden Table, and noticed some weird trends. Almost all the companies I looked at (with a few notable <a href="http://www.farm2tablecatering.com/" target="_blank"> exceptions</a>) had these vaguely razzle-dazzle, Las-Vegas-casino undertones to their branding. There felt like there was a lot of veneer between the craftspeople and the customers.</p>

    <p> After my first-hand experience with the Hidden Table, my impression of them was that they were actively trying to <i>remove</i> this separation. They goal was to actually make it all feel like a family meal. As far as I could tell, they were pushing things forward wth an artisanal, handcrafted, warm and rugged aesthetic.</p>

    <h2 class="center">The rules:
      <br />Make it feel like instagram.
      <br />Make it feel like a print magazine.
      <br />No stock photography allowed.</h2>

    <figure class="image large">
      <img src="/assets/img/work/tht/desktop_home2.png" />
    </figure>

    <p>Normally, I try to use the best existing brands in a client's sector as springboards to vault them into the top slot. With catering, however, even the most top rated companies&mdash;both local and national&mdash;seemed to have this veneer problem. It became evident I would be leaning heavily on my third little tenent, and begin to scour other industries.</p>

    <h4>The Joanna Gaines Factor: An Open Thank You Letter</h4>

    <p>Wedding catering is a major component of the Hidden Table's activity, but it is not <i>all</i> of their activity. Maybe it is about half. This was a crucial distinction, as the wedding industry has it's own very strong aesthetic. For companies that exist entirely in the wedding space, it's a no brainer to jump headfirst onto this bandwagon. But once you go there, that's kind of all you can be.</p>

    <p></p>

    <figure class="image medium">
      <img src="/assets/img/work/tht/magnolia.jpg" />
      <h2 class="center">Joanna Gaines knows how to design a fucking wedding magazine.</h2>
    </figure>

    <p>If the business I am designing for is at all servicing a younger crowd (which, I mean, is pretty much all businesses), this is my one aesthetic rule. The kids love their Instagram. Really, so do the adults. Everyone loves Instagram. I mean what's not to like? There's not even that much fighting in the comments section.</p>

    <p>So, here's an idea: why not take the richer content available on Facebook, and make it feel like Instagram content?</p>
