         <p class="big"><span class="lead">Elliott Stevens</span> can build anything. With a deep background in construction and large project management for forward-looking companies like Tesla Motors, he has long been capable of fielding and coordinating the countless variables, decisions, and individuals required to bringing massive pieces of infrastructure into existence. Despite this, his core passion has been for creation on a more intimate scale.</p>

         <p>Since he was a boy, Elliott has made furniture for...

         <h4>A Brief Story About A New Desk</h4>

         <p>My professional relationship with Elliott began when I commissioned a standing desk from him. To be clear, I am not what one would call a "furniture guy." There are very few objects that I care about. I tend to view possessions as ballast, and become far more giddy when getting rid of something than when acquiring it. Also, I already owned a standing desk. My relationship with it, however, was adversarial at best.</p>

        <p>My incumbent desk was IKEA-Star-Trek-modern, with an egregiously weightless particleboard top and hollowed out aluminum tube legs that telescoped up and down to adjust height. It seemed vaguely space-age. But it wasn't actually &mdash; I am confident NASA wouldn't let this thing anywhere near it. The slightest nudge would shift it around on the floor. The legs would secretly telescope of their own volition over time, so that I'd shuffle up to it in the morning to find my monitors at waist height. One of the legs gave out completely, and I had to supplant it with a colorful stack of free weights, found bricks, and math books I had given up on ever completing. None of this was ideal.</p>

        <p>Enter Elliott's finished commission. The top was a single lacquered plank from a redwood trunk, with all the natural features and contours left gently sanded but intact. The legs were comprised of 2-inch steel columns, welded together where stability mattered, then connected with bolts at a few key points to allow for painless disassembly and transport. It was a single height &mdash; a pre-established perfect working height for me &mdash; which is all I ever wanted in the first place. It had a much smaller footprint than the Star Trek desk, yet somehow there was always abundant room on its top. It was satisfyingly heavy when assembled, but trivially easy to move. It was simple, sturdy beyond belief, and stunning to look at.</p>

        <p>I had never been emotionally impacted by a household item, but the redwood desk was different. It felt <i>uniquely created for me</i>. This feeling made me realize how incredibly rarely our modern world provides it, and I found myself treasuring it deeply. The desk was so beautiful, and took up so little space that I moved it out of my designated home office and into my main living area. I got up earlier and got more done each day. I converted my old office into a mini-gym and a proper photography studio. I took more pride in my home and started cleaning and tending to it more. I began <i> a freaking daily gratitude practice</i>.</p>

        <p>Younger versions of me would never believe it, but this all actually happened &mdash; a piece of furniture changed my life.</p>

        <h3>Business Website</h3>

        <p>At the time, The Mill had no web presence, and I wanted create a website for them that successfully conveyed all the wonderful facets I had experienced as their customer.</p>

        <p>The signature of Elliott's craft seemed to me a little different than other bespoke furniture shops in the area. For one, most others seemed to put a very heavy emphasis on wood, whereas he consistently incorporated metals and concretes as equally vital design elements. His methods were just as much machine shop as woodworking studio. I also felt he had an identifiably singular aesthetic: a highly modern, rugged, all-bolts-exposed industrialism expressed with lyrical simplicity and sensitivity. The engineering was lucid and tightly economic, with every element having a clear purpose down to the smallest screw, and no unnecessary flourishes. Yet each piece was undeniably shaped by someone with an artist's heart and a deep sense of design.</p>

        <p>I did my best to use these principles to guide the creation of The Mill Creative's website and brand.</p>
