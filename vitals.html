        <p class="big"><span class="">Hey, I'm Dave. I am a web creative</span> and full-stack developer based in Sacramento, California. I build beautiful, clear-eyed web products and brands that achieve concise goals and tell real stories. I employ a content-first approach, and am dedicated to attentive communication and wide-open processes.</p>

        <h3><span>Background</span></h3>

        <!-- <p>I've worn a diverse set of professional hats, all of which inform my current approach to crafting web products. I have played with a major label band, built a best-in-space online publication, and co-founded a successful political tech startup, yet somehow hadn't managed to land on a true calling. </p> -->
        <p>I've worn a diverse set of professional hats, all of which inform my pursuit of making high-quality digital things.</p>

        <h4>Web Programming</h4>

        <p>I started hand-coding websites in 2008. I am equally comfortable with small static sites as with large-scale web apps with distributed deployment, and find unique joys in each. For languages, I lean heavily towards python and javascript. Check out <a href="/assets/cv.pdf">my CV</a> for more details, or <a href="https://github.com/middletond" target="_blank">my github</a> for code samples.
        </p>

        <h4>Online Publishing</h4>

        <p>For several years I built then ran the online division of a popular niche magazine. I learned a ton about branding, copywriting, design, and the power of trusting your own solutions over industry conventions. I wrote a full account of the experience <a href="/work/tape-op-magazine">here.</a></p>

        <h4>Public Data</h4>

        <p>I've spent much of the past few years building web apps that make public records research better and easier. More about that <a href="/work/public-data/">here</a>.</p>

        <h4>UI &amp; Graphic Design</h4>

        <p>Design is something I learned by necessity as I wore other hats, and grew to deeply love as an independent art. For both UI and graphic design, I value clarity of purpose, lyricism, and cohesion above all else. View my design work <a href="/work/">here</a>.</p>

        <h4>Music Production</h4>

        <p>I spent my twenties making music. I performed and toured extensively, but found a more natural home as a record producer. Making albums with music artists taught me how to assemble and manage teams, maintain a gestalt mindset, and deliver something beautiful and cohesive out of months of tiny technical decisions. I wrote a post about this <a href="/editorial/2018/10/28/can-artists-be-engineers/">here</a>.</p>
