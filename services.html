        <h2><b>Discrete</b> Services</h2>

        <h4>App &amp; Web Development</h4>
        <p>I have been a dedicated web developer for over ten years. I am equally comfortable working with small static sites as with large-scale web apps with distributed deployment, on a team or independently. I have played key technical roles in venture-backed startups and established businesses in both frontend and backend capacities.</p>

        <h4>UI / UX &amp; Graphic Design</h4>
        <p>Design is something I learned by necessity as I wore other hats, and grew to deeply love as an independent art. For both UI and graphic design, I value clarity of purpose, elegance, and cohesion above all else. I would say my greatest strength is a sensitivity to when things are truly "working" and when they are not. If I can't make something happen, I will fire myself and get someone who can.</p>

        <h4>Branding &amp; Messaging</h4>

        <p>Before anthing, we must know exactly <i>what</i> we're doing and <i>why</i> we are doing it. We must set about asking questions, continually, drilling down until we reach the root nature of our motivations and our actions. Only by understanding this properly can we create things that our true audience will connect with.</p>

      <h2>Producer Services</h2>

      <p>My most common method of working is to be a "producer" &mdash; that is, I faciliate a creative idea from inception to digital reality. In this method of working, I leverage all of my capacities as needed to best serve the project. I first work with you to get your idea into a clear and communicable package that is full of power and punch. Then I handle all the technical hurdles that are standing in your way, and if I cannot, I hire trusted folks who can.</p>
