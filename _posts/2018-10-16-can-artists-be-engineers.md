title:  "Do Artists Make Good Engineers?"
tagline: "Nikola Tesla believed artists made the best technicians.<br /> He also was by some measures clinically insane."
excerpt: "In my 20s, I was a professional musician. Half of my life was spent touring the country, and the other half was spent in California recording studios producing records. I had no idea I would one day write code"

<p class="big"><span class="lead">In my twenties,</span> my day job was being a musician. Half of my life was spent touring the country, and the other half was spent in California recording studios producing records. I had no idea I would one day write code.</p>

My conception of "programming" at the time was something akin to data entry, but maybe in a basement with a large bottle of Mountain Dew; it sounded mostly like carpal tunnel syndrome to me and my instrumentalist's brain. It made my forearms hurt just thinking about it. I had no idea that for each hour it was 58 minutes of pacing and thinking, followed by type-type-typing in three lines. I had no idea it was as creative as any fine art form.

In hindsight, it is easy to see how music producers and coders share the same challenge: take scattered gobs of complex technical stuff and somehow jam them together in a way that appears simple, natural, and magically human to the outside world. Recording an album and building an app both tend to have timelines of several months or more, with discrete brainstorming, planning, execution, and deployment phases. Both require persistent problem solving and committed decision-making in the face of uncertainty, at both micro and macro levels. Both are about leveraging technical things to achieve a non-technical human experience.

#### The Disparities

There are also notable contrasts. While there *are* actual technical problems in music (microphone doesn't work, etc), the real problems to solve are aesthetic. This means, how do you adjust things to make something feel more fragile, more aggressive, more like snow falling in a big city at night? Why does this one line of a vocal performance "work" while this other one does not?

To deal with these kinds of problems, you have to deal with the *gestalt*, the totality, the simultaneity of things. One takes in all aspects at once, makes subtle iterative movements toward the desired effect, and observes how those movements ripple outward to affect the whole. You take a bunch of linear elements, stack them all on top of each other, zoom waaaay out and judge the effect. In other words, your goal is to "make a good forest."

Coding is the opposite. You take a naturally simultaneous process, chop it up into all these bite-sized, grok-able components, and then string them all out like a clothesline into a step-by-step procedure. And yes, in a display of tidy symmetry, there are aesthetic considerations involved in coding, but the *real* problems to solve are technical. Roughly speaking, your goal as a programmer is to "make good trees."

I mention all this because it defined my process of *making things*. Perhaps more crucially, it informed some initial blind spots to best practices that had to be seared away with painful outcomes.

From a process standpoint, the technical and the artistic also have their differences. The biggest of these lies in what happens at the moment where we *finally get our thing to work*. This moment is a shared and cherished universal of anyone who creates; both technicians and artists all know and hunger after the vivid dopamine aftershocks from those precious occasions. We even have the same phrases to describe them:

*"Then things fell into place."*

*"Then everything came together."*

For most creators, such moments are the literal peak experiences of life. That electric, child-like manifestor essence within us is jumping up and down ecstatically with clapping hands. What proceeds from here, however, is very different.

#### Finish Line or Starting Line?

If I play back my song and everything feels balanced and just so and makes the persons in the room feel the things they want to feel, I can pack it all up and call it a day. With art, deployment time is party time. The only real uncertainty after the initial victory is, "will I still feel the same things when I play this back tomorrow?" (which oftentimes you don't, because things feel different at different times and contexts, and all that is terrifying and mysterious, but that is another article) But really, you are more or less finished. The race is ended. You *won*.

Technical things are different. That first eureka moment is only the first leg in the race. Okay, this thing *works*, for a single user, in a single environment, in a single test. But will it work *again?* Will it work *a thousand times in a row?* Will it work for *a thousand people at once?* How about a *million?* When it doesn't work, how will we know about it? As an artist, these were completely foreign considerations. Scale and consistency were not issues I had ever needed to handle.
