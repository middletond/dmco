title:  "What To Do When You're Not Smart Enough"
tagline: "General intelligence is likely fixed (sorry). But there is still something we can do about it."
excerpt: "If we deify intelligence,we will tend to defer to it. This essentially translates into “let our most intelligent people control projects, and do whatever they want.” Oftentimes, this can be a good thing, but other times it is not. How does one tell the difference? Intelligence becomes more valuable when iteration fails."

In my 20s, I was a professional musician. Half of my life was spent touring the country, and the other half was spent in California recording studios producing records.

I had no idea I would one day write code. My conception of “programming" at the time was something akin to data entry, but maybe in a basement with a large bottle of Mountain Dew; it sounded mostly like carpal tunnel syndrome to me and my instrumentalist’s brain. I had no idea that for each hour it was 58 minutes of pacing and thinking, followed by type-type-typing in three lines. I had no idea it was as creative as any fine art form.

In hindsight, it is easy to see how music producers and coders share the same challenge. We take scattered gobs of complex technical stuff and somehow jam them together in a way that appears simple, natural, and magically human to the outside world. It is also easy to see similarities of process. Both tend to have lengthy timelines of several months or more, with discrete brainstorming, planning, execution, and deployment phases. Both require persistent problem solving and committed decision-making in the face of uncertainty, at both micro and macro levels. Both are about leveraging technical things to achieve a non-technical human experience. 

Of course, there are also differences. While there are actual technical problems in music (microphone doesn’t work, etc), the real problems to solve are aesthetic. This means, how do you adjust things to make something feel more fragile, more aggressive, more like, say... snow falling in a big city at night? Why does this one line of a vocal performance “work” while this other one does not? To deal with these kinds of problems, you have to deal with the gestalt, the totality, the simultaneity of things. One takes in all aspects at once, makes subtle iterative movements toward the desired effect, and observes how those movements ripple outward to affect the whole. You take a bunch of linear elements, stack them all on top of each other, zoom waaaay out and judge the effect. In other words, your goal is to “make a good forest.” 

Coding is the opposite. You take a naturally simultaneous process, chop it up into all these bite-sized, grok-able components, and then string them all out like a clothesline into a step-by-step procedure. And yes, in a display of gratifyingly tidy symmetry, there are aesthetic considerations involved in coding, but the real problems to solve are technical. Roughly speaking, your goal as a programmer is to “make good trees.”
